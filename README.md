The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design 
goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small 
message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation
([RFC8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#abstract)). It is used
in different protocols like [CTAP](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html#ctap2-canonical-cbor-encoding-form) 
and [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#cbor) (FIDO2).
